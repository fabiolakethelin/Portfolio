                <h3>A <span>Front-End Developer</span></h3>
                <p>My passion for web development started in high school, so I started studying information systems to turn that passion into a career. I love the challenge of taking a design from concept to reality or finding creative solutions to complex problems.</p>
                <p>I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn. I'm a big believer in the power of collaboration and communication, and I enjoy working closely with designers and other developers to create the best possible product.</p>
